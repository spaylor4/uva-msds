# Module 0: Review of Statistical Inference

#### Sampling Distributions

- Histograms summarize quantitative data by showing how many observations occur in each range. From histograms, you can see the center, symmetry or lack thereof, and general distribution of the sample.
- Probability density functions (pdfs) are mathematical representations of the distribution of the data  (as if you drew a curve following the outline of a histogram). They must be non-negative and integrate to 1.
- Normal distribution is symmetrical and bell-shaped.
- Standard normal distribution has mean 0 and standard dev 1.
- Any normal distribution can be standardized by $z = (x - \mu)/\theta$, often called the z score.

#### Populations and Samples

- Parameters are characteristics of a population; statistics are characteristics of samples. Samples used to estimate unknown parameters.
- Sampling distribution is the distribution of the sample statistics. Under certain circumstances, sampling distributions can be well-approximated by a specific distribution and its pdf.
