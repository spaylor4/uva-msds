## Module 1: Data Conceptualization and Intro to Python

#### What is Data?

- Data is _uninterpreted_ information.

- Important to consider the source, quality, scale, and variety of your data.

- Data by itself is useless. Information is data compared to or associated with other things (context, patterns, relationships, etc.). Knowledge is information learned, applied, and understood.

  Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Decisions

- Data science can enable the creation of data products (ex. Google swine flu tracking).

#### Intro to Python

- Python is a high-level language
- Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you don't have to specify variable data type upon creation.
- Python id(var) function returns the unique identifier of an object, which will remain constant throughout its lifetime. This can be thought of as the address of the object in memory.
- Tuples have most of the same properties as lists, with the key difference that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.
- Python namespaces are basically variable scopes and contain variables and methods that are defined.
- A sentinel value is a value that carries a special meaning in a program.
- For loops create internal iterators. Can explicitly create an iterator using `iter(item)` where item is a sequence of data (e.g. list or dictionary). Can then proceed through the items in the iterator using `next(iterator)`.
- As far as this course goes, the most important thing when it comes to coding style is consistency. Companies often have their own style guidelines ([PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is common for Python).
