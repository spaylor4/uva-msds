## Module 1: Data Conceptualization and Intro to Python

#### What is Data?

- Data is _uninterpreted_ information.

- Important to consider the source, quality, scale, and variety of your data.

- Data by itself is useless. Information is data compared to or associated with other things (context, patterns, relationships, etc.). Knowledge is information learned, applied, and understood.

  Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Decisions

- Data science can enable the creation of data products (ex. Google swine flu tracking).

#### Intro to Python

- Python is a high-level language
- Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you don't have to specify variable data type upon creation.
