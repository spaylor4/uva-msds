## Module 6: Software Engineering

- Software engineering involves building large systems and modifying them over time in a disciplined, scientific way.
- Software development lifecycle involves requirements (specs from client on what system should do), design (creation of a blueprint for how a solution will be implemented), implementation (coding), integration (combining parts of the system and ensuring they work together in the environment), and maintenance (fixing errors, adding enhancements, and adapting to work in changing environments).
  - Maintenance is generally the largest phase.
- Two types of requirements: functional and non-functional. Functional requirements describe what the system should do, but not how it should do it. Non-functional requirements describe how something is done, and add qualities and/or constraints to a functional requirement.
  - Non-functional requirements must be objective rather than subjective, else they can't be tested.
  - Non-functional requirements often involve accessibility, privacy, efficiency, scalability, etc.
  - Constraints are client-expressed design requests that are often implementation-specific.
- Want to find errors as early as possible, as they become more expensive when they are found later in the lifecycle.
- When coding, you should alternate between coding and testing, quickly testing each small addition to your code as you go. Don't code something that depends on other things that haven't been tested.

#### Class Discussion: Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements

Are each of the following functional or non-functional requirements?

- The reloading of the user statistics  performs 90% of the time below 100 ms. when tested on machines with the  performances specified in appendix G part 2 and the load below 10% for  the CPU, below 50% for memory and no active R/W disk operations. **Non-functional**
- The application is written in C#. **Non-functional**
- The main window of the application  has a blue (#00f) 10px border with pink (#fcc) filled circles, those  circles being placed at the inner edge of the border and being 3px in  diameter, separated by 20px from each other. **Functional**
- The vehicle tracking system measures the speed with a precision of Â±0.016 mph. **Non-functional**
- The vehicle tracking system measures the speed of the vehicle. **Functional**
- The pages of the website take 850 ms. to load. **Non-functional**
