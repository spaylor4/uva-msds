# Model-Free Control



### Class Notes

*March 11, 2021*

- Model free control *optimizes*, whereas model free prediction *estimates*.
- On-policy "learns on the job" (learn about policy $\pi$ from experience sampled from $\pi$); off-policy learns by "looking over someone's shoulder" (learn about policy $\pi$ from experience sampled from $b$).
