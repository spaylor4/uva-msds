## Module 8: Scrum Agile Methodology

- Scrum is an agile process focused on delivering the highest business value in the shortest time.
  - Allows rapid & repeated inspection of actual working software.
- User stories are the scrum way of stating requirements: "as a [user type], I want to [user action] [for reason]." The reason is optional but can aid in design, interface, or placement.
  - Stories should focus on "who," "what," and "why," but not "how." Stories are high-level statements.
  - Important to know your user/customer and understand customer value. Can have multiple "who-why" pairs for a single "what." Different users may have different functional needs and interact with different parts of the system. Considering different users also helps with prioritization.
  - Including a reason helps assign value to the story (is it nice to have or critical to the product), direct how the function should be implemented, and inform on placement, accessibility, and usability of the feature.
  - User stories contain acceptance criteria (what it means to be done) and tasks (all the things needed to implement the story).
- The product backlog consists of the complete set of stories that describe what the entire system does. User stories in the product backlog can be added, removed, or modified as new information is acquired.
  - Each user story in the backlog usually contains an estimate of how long it will take to complete.
  - Stories are prioritized by the product owner/client, then reprioritized by the team at the start of each sprint.
- Development is divided into a series of "sprints" of a set period of time (e.g. two weeks, a month) in which a working version/prototype of selected stories is created.
  - The sprint backlog is a selected subset of the product backlog chosen for the current sprint.
  - Tasks are usually assigned to stories when they are selected from the product backlog into the sprint backlog. Team members then select which tasks they would like to work on.
  - Each sprint produces a version of working code.
  - Team members choose their own tasks, rather than having them assigned.
- Daily scrum meetings are held to assess progress and discuss issues.
  - Each team member shares what they did yesterday, what they're working on today, and their main impediment.
  - Meetings are kept short (~15 minutes).
- Scrum teams do a little of each phase (requirements, design, code, test) at the same time (overlapping development) rather than all of one thing at a time (linear development).
- All members of the team have a specific role (e.g. Project Manager, Software Architect, UI Designer, Quality Assurance Manager) for which they are responsible (though this doesn't mean they are doing everything for that area).
