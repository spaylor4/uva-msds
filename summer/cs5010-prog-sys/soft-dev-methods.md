## Module 7: Software Dev Methods & Models

- Organizations have process models outlining the tasks and their sequence used in development.
  - Having a process helps managers and team members stay on the same page and helps the organization find and repeat good processes.
  - Software methodology is like an implemented process and contains details on techniques, documents, etc.

#### The Waterfall & Spiral Methods

- In the waterfall method, the developer completes one phase before moving on to the next (order of phases is requirements, design, code, test, maintenance).
  - Flaws in this method center around the need for iteration and feedback. Also, testing should be done throughout and should not be its own phase.
  - This method does not emphasize risk management, prototyping, and quality, all of which are important.
- In the spiral model, development cycles through stages (plan, objectives, risks, develop/test) several times.

#### Agile Methodologies

- Plan-driven methodologies involve all process activities being planned in advance and progress being measured against the plan. Agile methodologies are more flexible to changing customer requirements, as planning is done incrementally.
  - Traditionally, methodologies have been plan-driven and are called "heavyweight" and "high ceremony."
  - Agile is "lightweight" and focuses less on documentation and more on frequent interaction with the customer. It emphasizes iterative development of requirements and code.
  - Scrum (most-used), CrystalClear, and Extreme Programming (XP) are examples of agile.
- Agile is good for risky projects with dynamic requirements.
- Scrum is an agile process involving cycles of 2-4 week "sprints."
