Keeping track of R functions, use cases, and interpretations learned throughout the course.

### Supervised Learning

- `poly()` is convenient for modeling polynomial terms. For example, `poly(x, degree = 2)` creates $x^2$, $x$, and intercept terms.
- `knn.reg()` from the `FNN` package fits a KNN model.
- `rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)` creates a vector of normal random variables of length $n$.
